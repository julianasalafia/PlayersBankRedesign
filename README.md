# PLAYERS BANK [REDESIGN]

I was really inspired by the Player's Bank redesign idea from [Wallyngson Guedes](https://www.behance.net/gallery/160208549/Players-Bank-Redesign), it got me thinking about some of the studies I was planning to do while I was part of the team. I know those screens like the back of my hand, and it struck me that it could be really cool to give them a fresh new look using Flutter. I think it could really take the project to the next level :)
